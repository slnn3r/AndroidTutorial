**“Every Journey Begins With A Single Step.” – Maya Angelou**

When you think about to develop a Mobile Apps you cannot avoid the needs to adapt the MAD concept (aka Mobile Application Development). In MAD, things may work differently from **Web Application, Windows Application and other application development**. This documentation would mainly focus on MAD of **Android Platform**, it is not a step-by-step guidelines but it includes necessary resources that may give you the rough idea on getting started with MAD. There is no steep learning curve in MAD, so one step a time and you are good.

## Understanding Mobile Development

**Mobile vs Web Application**

There are some differences between Mobile and Web, I would highlight few points that differentiate both of them.

1. **Availability** - Web application rely on Internet Connection to being available for user to use, where Mobile application are mostly support both online and offline mode. Mobile application is a huge win when developing apps that required offline capability while it still able to support online functionality as well.

2. **Accessibility** - Web application tend to have higher accessibility than Mobile application, as web application is cross platform where it can be access by any online device in most web browser, while Mobile application have accessibility restriction by Mobile Platform such as Android, IOS, Windows, etc. Also, in Android, Mobile application's accessibility tend to restricted by the Android Version where older version Android is no longer support latest developed application.

3. **Capability** - Function Capability of Web and Mobile Application are very close to each other (check out: [What Web Can Do](https://whatwebcando.today/)), however there are still things that web application would not able to perform, but things where web application would perform better than Mobile application. 

These are the things I highlighted as you would need to consider about them when you trying to develop a solution. Compatibility of the solution may vary depends on the technical requirements, business nature, etc. So, before develop a Mobile Application, make sure the solution work best in it.
