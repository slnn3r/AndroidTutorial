**“Every Journey Begins With A Single Step.” – Maya Angelou**

When you think about to develop a Mobile Apps you cannot avoid the needs to adapt the MAD concept (aka Mobile Application Development). In MAD, things may work differently from **Web Application, Windows Application and other application development**. This documentation would mainly focus on MAD of **Android Platform**, it is not a step-by-step guidelines but it includes necessary resources that may give you the rough idea on getting started with MAD. There is no steep learning curve in MAD, so one step a time and you are good.

## Understanding Mobile Development

**Mobile vs Web Application**

There are some differences between Mobile and Web, I would highlight few points that differentiate both of them.

1. **Availability** - Web application rely on Internet Connection to being available for user to use, where Mobile application are mostly support both online and offline mode. Mobile application is a huge win when developing apps that required offline capability while it still able to support online functionality as well.

2. **Accessibility** - Web application tend to have higher accessibility than Mobile application, as web application is cross platform where it can be access by any online device in most web browser, while Mobile application have accessibility restriction by Mobile Platform such as Android, IOS, Windows, etc. Also, in Android, Mobile application's accessibility tend to restricted by the Android Version where older version Android is no longer support latest developed application.

3. **Capability** - Function Capability of Web and Mobile Application are very close to each other (check out: [What Web Can Do](https://whatwebcando.today/)), however there are still things that web application would not able to perform, but things where web application would perform better than Mobile application.

These are the things I highlighted as you would need to consider about them when you trying to develop a solution. Compatibility of the solution may vary depends on the technical requirements, business nature, etc. So, before develop a Mobile Application, make sure the solution work best in it.

**Mobile Application Category**

There are various type of Mobile Application, each of them access through Mobile Device but offer different advantages toward each other, here are some common Mobile Application Category currently available:

1. **Mobile Web Application** - It is basically a Website that access by using a **Web Browser Mobile Apps** or [WebView](https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2014/10/09/do-u-webview/) in a Mobile Device. Will have some different compare to the "Desktop Version" of Website such as Screen Design may design to match Mobile Device screen size, able to access Mobile Device hardware, etc. Code in Web Language, such as HTML, JAVASCRIPT, etc and as long there is a web browser and internet connection, it can be access by any Mobile Device without any installation of file.

2. **Mobile Native Application** - It is a mobile application that coded in **Native Language** and only work on Native Platform. For an example, an Application is coded in JAVA Language and it only able to run at Android Platform or an Application is coded in SWIFT Language and it only able to run at IOS Platform, both of these Application is a Mobile Native Application. It required installation to the mobile device before it can be launch and having the offline capability.

3. **Mobile Hybrid Application** - It is a mobile application that run in the [WebView](https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2014/10/09/do-u-webview/) of the Mobile Device. It is coded in Web Technology like HMTL, JAVASCRIPT, etc while it still able to work offline on the device, it required installation but it able to work on most type platform such as Android, IOS, Windows, etc on different devices.

4. **Mobile Compiled Application** - Similar like the Mobile Hybrid Application, it able to work offline, does required installation, cross platform but it does not run in the [WebView](https://www.stevesouders.com/blog/2014/10/09/do-u-webview/) and its performance is faster than the Mobile Hybrid Application. Coded in [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/), basically full JAVASCRIPT.

There are the brief description of different category of Mobile Application. The Mobile Hybrid Application and Mobile Compiled Application sometimes can be hard to differentiate, but still both of them are on a different page. Here a ([well-explained video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rb8smP_xTTY)) if you really wanted to get to know more about the differences among the Mobile Application above.
